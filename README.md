# SpaceX Launch Success Classification

This repository contains code and resources for classifying the success of SpaceX launches using machine learning techniques. The project aims to predict whether a SpaceX launch will be successful based on various factors and features.

## Repository Structure

- **data**: Contains datasets used for training and testing the classification models.
- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- **scripts**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and other tasks.
- **models**: Saved trained models for future use or deployment.
- **reports**: Reports generated from the analysis, including model performance metrics and visualizations.
- **README.md**: This file providing an overview of the repository.

## Classification Task

The classification task involves predicting the success outcome of SpaceX launches, which is typically binary (successful or unsuccessful). Features used for classification may include launch date, mission type, payload mass, launch site, and other relevant factors.

## Analysis Overview

The analysis includes the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering historical data on SpaceX launches from public sources or APIs.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, filtering, and transforming the raw data to prepare it for analysis.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extracting, selecting, or creating relevant features for the classification task.
4. **Model Selection**: Choosing appropriate machine learning algorithms for classification, such as logistic regression, random forests, or neural networks.
5. **Model Training**: Training classification models using labeled data from past SpaceX launches.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of trained models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
7. **Model Deployment**: If applicable, deploying the trained models for real-time or batch predictions.
